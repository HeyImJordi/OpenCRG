===== Contents

The _header information_ section contains unstructured plain text.

===== Rules

* An OpenCRG data file shall contain a _header information_ section.
* The _header information_ section shall be the first section in an OpenCRG data file.
* The _header information_ section should give information about the content of the file.

===== Examples

----
$CT
CRG file example for road surface description (width: 3m, length: 22m)
with curved reference line and grid of (0.25m...1.0m) x 1.0m.

A minimalist file can have an empty $CT, a minimalist $ROAD_CRG block,
and no comments marked by asterisk "*" in column 1 or marked by "!" in
other columns. So this file is completely equivalent to its commented
version in handmade_curved.crg .
