=== Curved regular grids

A curved regular grid represents road surface data in proximity of an arbitrary road-center line. The road surface is tiled into a curved grid. Longitudinal cuts are parallel to the road-center line. Lateral cuts are orthogonal to the road-center line. One road data value is assigned to each tile. Road surface data usually represents road elevation but may also be used for other data, e. g. friction.

Curved regular grids use a reference line coordinate system. The road-center line is given by a curved reference line. The u-direction follows the tangent of the reference line. The v-direction is orthogonal to the u-direction. Road surface data is given in z-direction orthogonal to the u/v-plane.

A curved reference line is defined by series of low-precision heading angles. A curved regular grid can be placed in an inertial x/y-coordinate system by providing a high-precision start position in x/y-coordinates. To avoid drift when integrating along the reference line, an optional high-precision end position in x/y-coordinates can be provided. One can then use both forward integration and backward integration to calculate reference position data. The given start and end positions can be compared to the integration results to determine whether the input describes a smooth track.

The reference line may be complemented by slope or banking.
