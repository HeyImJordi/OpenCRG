=== Comments

An OpenCRG file may contain comments with further information about the file. These comments shall not substitute the introductory header information section.

There are two types of comments in an OpenCRG file:

Block comment:: An asterisk (`*`) at the beginning of a line causes the entire line to be treated as a comment.

Inline comment:: An exclamation mark (`!`) causes all following characters to be treated as a comment.
