The OpenCRG format provides a common base for describing road surfaces. 

#TODO needs to be changed

The data that is stored in an OpenDRIVE file describes the geometry of roads as well as features along the roads that influence the logics, for example, lanes and signals. The road networks that are described in the OpenDRIVE file can either be synthetic or real. The main purpose of OpenDRIVE is to provide a road network description that can be fed into simulations and to make these road network descriptions exchangeable. 

The format is organized in nodes that can be extended with user defined data. This facilitates a high degree of specialization for individual applications (usually simulations) while maintaining the interoperability that is required for the exchange of data between different applications.
