=== Setting options

With the Matlab tools, Options stored with OpenCRG data are automatically taken into account when evaluating the data.

With the C-API, options are set via function calls. For all options and values, symbolic constants are defined in `_opencrg_/c-api/baselib/inc/crgBaseLib.h`. These constants should be used instead of their integer equivalents to improve readability of the code.

With Matlab, options are set by directly accessing the `opts` field of a data set using dot notation.

[NOTE]
====
Options, whether defined in an OpenCRG file or via function calls, are applied automatically when executing an evaluation call.
