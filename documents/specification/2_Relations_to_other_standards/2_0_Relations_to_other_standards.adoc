=== Positioning of ASAM OpenCRG within ASAM activities

#ASAM OpenDRIVE is part of the ASAM simulation standards that focus on simulation data for the automotive environment. Next to ASAM OpenDRIVE, ASAM Provides other standards for the simulation domain, like ASAM OpenSCENARIO and ASAM openCRG.#

=== Relation of ASAM OpenCRG to OpenDRIVE and OpenSCENARIO

#ASAM OpenDRIVE defines a storage format for the static description of road networks. In combination with ASAM OpenCRG it is possible to add very detailed road surface descriptions to the road network. ASAM OpenDRIVE and ASAM OpenCRG only contains static content. To add dynamic content ASAM OpenSCENARIO is needed. Combined all three standards provide a scenario-driven description of traffic simulation that contains static and dynamic content#

=== Backward compatibility to earlier releases

#OpenDRIVE 1.6 contains elements that were introduced in version 1.5 but are not compatible with version 1.4. To ensure compatibility with versions 1.4 and 1.5, these elements are technically defined as optional in the XML schema of version 1.6. They are marked as “Optional for backwards compatibility” in the annotations of the UML model.#
