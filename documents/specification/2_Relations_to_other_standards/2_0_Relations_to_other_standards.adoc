=== Positioning of ASAM OpenCRG within ASAM activities

ASAM OpenDCRG is part of the ASAM simulation standards that focus on simulation data for the automotive environment. Next to ASAM OpenCRG, ASAM Provides other standards for the simulation domain, like ASAM OpenDRIVE and ASAM openSCENARIO.

=== Relation of ASAM OpenCRG to OpenDRIVE and OpenSCENARIO

ASAM OpenCRG defines a storage format for the static description of road surfaces. In combination with ASAM OpenDRIVE it is possible to add very detailed road surface descriptions to road networks. ASAM OpenDRIVE and ASAM OpenCRG only contains static content. To add dynamic content ASAM OpenSCENARIO is needed. Combined all three standards provide a scenario-driven description of traffic simulation that contains static and dynamic content

=== Backward compatibility to earlier releases

//REVIEW: Is this statement correct?

ASAM OpenCRG 1.2. is backward comaptible to OpenCRG 1.1.2
