==== Source code of test programs

The source code of the test programs for the C-API is stored in `_open-crg_/c-api/test/` and comprises the following:

`Dump/`:: Read an OpenCRG file and write all values (x, y, z, u, v) into a text file `crgDump.txt`.
`MemTest/`:: Test allocating and releasing OpenCRG data sets.
`MultiCp/`:: Test multiple contact points.
`MultiRead/`:: Read multiple data files and evaluate the last file.
`PerfTest/`:: Tool for evaluating the performance of the library.
`Scan/`:: Perform an x/y-scan of an OpenCRG data set.
`Verify/`:: Reads an OpenCRG file and a reference text file containing x/y/z data or x/y/z/u/v data. Calculates the z-values at the given x/y locations from the OpenCRG file and compares the result with the z-values from the reference text file.
