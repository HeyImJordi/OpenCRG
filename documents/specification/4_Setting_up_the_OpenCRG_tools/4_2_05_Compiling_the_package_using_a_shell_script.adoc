==== Compiling the C-API using a shell script

Using a shell script for compiling is appropriate, if you cannot compile the software package using the provided make files.

In contrast to using the Makefiles, no library containing the object files of the basic library is generated.


===== Prerequisites

* You downloaded and unpacked the OpenCRG software package.
* Your computer provides an environment for executing shell scripts.
* You have installed a C-compiler on your computer.

===== Steps

. Open the shell script `c-api/compileScript.sh` in a text editor.
. Find the variable `COMP` and set it to the name of your compiler.
. Save your changes to the script.
. Execute the script.

===== Result

* Executable test files are generated in `c-api/test/bin/`.
* Executable demo files are generated in `c-api/demo/bin/`.

===== What to do next

Test the C-API to ensure that it is set up correctly.
