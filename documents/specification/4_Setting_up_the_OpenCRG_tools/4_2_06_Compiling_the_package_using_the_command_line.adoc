==== Compiling the C-API using the command line

The C-API can be compiled manually, for example, to compile only selected sample programs.

===== Prerequisites

* You downloaded and unpacked the OpenCRG software package.
* A C-compiler is installed on your computer.

===== Steps

The procedure depends on the C-compiler. When compiling, observe the following hints:

* Set your include file search path to `baselib/inc`.
* Always compile in combination with all .c-files in `baselib/src`.
